Each sage Philosopher, each learn'd Divine,             185
And patriot Worthies, an illustrious Line:
All those, who nobly fill Fame's ample Page
Again revive to grace a future Age--
Blest Institution hail ! methinks I see
The shining Throng ascribe their Birth to THEE.         190

THOU Schuylkill, from whose Clifts I love to view
Thy gurgling Stream it's rorky Way pursue,
Shall own the Change--the savage Yell no more
With rougher Sounds shall rend thy rugged Shoar.
Oh let thy Groves their richest Beauties wear,          195
And for approaching happier Times prepare

ALONG thy Banks the penfive Bard shall stray,
Sweep the sweet Lyre, and wake the tuneful Lay;
Echo shall love to catch the melting Sound,
And bid it soften all thy Rocks around                  200
