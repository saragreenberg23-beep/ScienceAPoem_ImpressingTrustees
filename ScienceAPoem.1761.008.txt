GENTLEMEN, 
IT is not without great Expectations from your Candour
and Indulgence, that I am encouraged to lay this little
Poem at your Feet.
I do not flatter myself that your Institution will hereby
derive any additional Lustre; but only take this Opportunity
of publickly acknowledging my Affection and Gratitude
to that Seat of SCIENCE.
May all your Undertakings for its Advancement meet
with more than expected Success: And may it never want
Friends to Suport it with equal Zeal, but greater Abilities
than I can boast.
I am, GENTLEMEN,
Your most obliged
humble Servant,
F. H.
