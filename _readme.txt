He wrote this poem to appeal to the Trustees of the university and promote the University’s advancements in science. From handling the document, it was clear that the author was trying hard to impress the Trustees with his poem. For this reason, the metadata I chose to record are ways that the document goes above and beyond to impress and address its intended audience. This includes elements within the text, such as the presence of second person language, where the author tries to communicate directly with the audience, potentially to appeal to them. I also documented elements of the pages themselves, such as presence of a catch word and signature, which show that the book was sent a professional publisher, another potential way for the author to appeal to the intended audience. I documented when the files had line numbers and page numbers, which shows how the book was made accessible for the audience to read. I documented changes in the font of the text, such as the presence italics and small caps, which could have been used to make certain phrases stand out within the text or to convey humility to the audience. Lastly, I documented whether the file was part of the dedication or poem part of the book, as the dedication is a clear way for the author to speak directly to the audience, and the rhyming poem (presence of rhyme is also documented) could be a way to impress the trustees. All these pieces of metadata within the physical book can serve as evidence that Hopkinson used this poem to sway the Trustees about the importance of the study of science, so I found it important that they were documented.


Extracting and Cleaning text:
The book I am working with is a typed document, so I was able to use OCR to extract my text. First, I uploaded the jpg files of each pages from last week to Adobe Acrobat, where it transformed them into PDFs. Then, I was able to click "Scan and OCR" for each page of the book. Once the OCR was complete, I was able to copy and paste the scanned text into a Visual Studio Code text file (one for each page). Once I had all my text copied into Visual Studio Code, I had to edit the text by hand. I found that the biggest issue I faced was that the long S and script t letters were recognized as a lowercase f. I had to go in and change each letter that was mistyped. This error came up a few times were page. Another error I encountered was that the OCR could recognize and handle most of the small caps font, but it could not show the italics font, which could cause the text to lack emphasis on certain desired words. Next, there were a couple of places where there were hand-written notes written in the margin or printed over text, and the OCR scanner could not pick up on it. Since it was just a few words written sparsely, I was able to just type it into the .txt file, but I could not note that those words were handwritten, or that some handwritten words were written on top of typed words. Finally, the OCR scanner had a hard time aligning the line number to the correct line when I copied the text over to the .txt file, so I had to manually change the position of the line numbers relative to the text. For the most part, the OCR scanner did a good job recognizing the printed text, but the fancier fonts (long S and italics) and line numbers posed the largest issues that I needed to fix.
