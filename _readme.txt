He wrote this poem to appeal to the Trustees of the university and promote the University’s advancements in science. From handling the document, it was clear that the author was trying hard to impress the Trustees with his poem. For this reason, the metadata I chose to record are ways that the document goes above and beyond to impress and address its intended audience. This includes elements within the text, such as the presence of second person language, where the author tries to communicate directly with the audience, potentially to appeal to them. I also documented elements of the pages themselves, such as presence of a catch word and signature, which show that the book was sent a professional publisher, another potential way for the author to appeal to the intended audience. I documented when the files had line numbers and page numbers, which shows how the book was made accessible for the audience to read. I documented changes in the font of the text, such as the presence italics and small caps, which could have been used to make certain phrases stand out within the text or to convey humility to the audience. Lastly, I documented whether the file was part of the dedication or poem part of the book, as the dedication is a clear way for the author to speak directly to the audience, and the rhyming poem (presence of rhyme is also documented) could be a way to impress the trustees. All these pieces of metadata within the physical book can serve as evidence that Hopkinson used this poem to sway the Trustees about the importance of the study of science, so I found it important that they were documented.
