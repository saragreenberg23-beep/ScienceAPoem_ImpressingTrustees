[ 19 ]
And still the Rocks of Criticism fly,
Or fearless pass Oblivion's Quicksands by.
Enough for me, if, with the least Regard,
The Friends of Science shall my Song reward.        220
No speedy Death my artless Strains shall know,
Nor without Honour will my Numbers flow,
If thus indulgent THEY shall not refuse.
To smile propitious on my humble Muse,
FINIS.
