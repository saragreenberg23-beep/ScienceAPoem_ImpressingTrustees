[ 12 ]
O'er new reap'd Fields with airy Step she roves,
And paints with various Hue the fading Groves.
Then boisi'rous Winter howls along the Plain,
Affrighted Vegetation shrinks again             110
Back into Earth--Woods, Hills and Valleys stand
Stripp'd of their Pride by his relentless Hand ;
In icy Bonds he holds the Water's Fall,
And in his snowy Mantle wraps them all.

THUS shall his Eye important Truths pursue,     115
And in HIS Worksthe Great CREATOR view.
The painted Birds that wing the liquid Sky;
The varied Flowers that glow with grateful Dye;
The clustring Fruits that smile in Plenty round;
The Herbs medicinal that strew the Ground;      120
ALL must the Philosophic Bosom move
To Wonder, Gratitude and glowing Love.
                                                AND
