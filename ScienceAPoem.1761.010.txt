Thou who canst bid the eager Spirit rise,
And dip her Plumage in the dewy Skies ;         10
Once more propitious to my Pray'r attend!
Once more, CELESTIAL MUSE! thy Influence lend.

FAIR SCIENCE softning, with reforming Hand
The native Rudeness of a barbarous Land ;
Her radiant Throne, uprais'd by Pow'r divine;   15
Her numerous Sons low bending at her Shrine
I sing--Oh could my artless Numbers seem
To flow inspir'd, and equal to my Theme!

YE Friends of Learning patronize my Song,
To You the tributary Strains belong.            20
But chiefly THOU, beneath whose gentle Sway
The Muse delights to swell the pleasing Lay;
Glad Science THEE shall her MAECENAS hail,
Wisdom shall smile, and heav'nly Truth prevail.
