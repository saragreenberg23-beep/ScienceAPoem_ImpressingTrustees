Ev'n now thy flow'ry Paths I see him tread,
And pluck thy Laurels to adorn his Head :
How shall thy Waves elate flow proudly by,
And grow more turgid, but to catch his Eye.
Thy rural Scenes shall flouriih in his Song,            205
And each romantic Height his Strains prolong.

THERE, whilst his Breast with sacred Ardor burns,
RELIGION, JUSTICE, LIBERTY, by Turns,
And SCIENCE too, in more harmonious Strains,
Shall sweetly warble to the Woods and Plains            210

PERHAPS the Bard, when highest Noon prevails,
Beneath some Shade shall court refreshing Gales ;
And, whilst his wand'ring Fancy roves more free,
May chance to think on earlier Times, and me--
Presumptuous Thought! shall my unpracris'dLay           215
Be born in Safety down Times rapid Way;
                                                        And
